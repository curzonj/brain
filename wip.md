* I need to DRY the margins or padding around the pages. Currently it looks like the topic page is the only one with page margins and they are on the sections instead of the whole page.
* Things on the search page
  * autofocus on the search field
  * debounce the onChange field, that probably means moving to a class component
* move search to the menu page and rename the menu to home page and and a link to the index there
