# brain

This is the front end to my personal knowledge base system.

It is an unhosted application that stores it's data in replicated
and/or decentralized data stores that are configured client-side.

The deployed static files are available via github pages:

# development

to serve local files with a url you can use:

```bash
npx http-server -c-1
```
